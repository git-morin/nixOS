# Typescript

I use typescript both professionally and in my hobby programming.

I consider typescript to be a tolerable flavor of javascript.
I am not specialized in front-end development, so my opinion is probably biased by how most backend languages tend to be more strict.

Here's a series of tools/libraries/dependencies I've used so far from the node ecosystem which I liked:

- react
- ts-node
- pnpm
- tanstack
- vite
- vinxi
- shadcn
- biomeJS
