# NixOS

I use NixOS to set up my *nix environments.

I currently have four machines which run nix derivations:

- [[main]]# My main personal machine (NixOS)
- [[server]]# My homelab server machine (NixOS)
- [[wsl]]# My nixOS set up for a WSL machine (NixOS-WSL)
- [[macos]]# My work MacBook (nix-darwin)

There is also:
- [[hosts]] # My nixOS derivations for each host (includes common)

You can find most of my nixOS code in this notebook.
I've added comments to places I felt we're adequate

- [[lib]]# My nix functions re-used in my derivations
- [[homes]]# My home-manager configurations for my various hosts
- [[flakes]]# My flake-parts derivations

Here's a mermaid diagram trying to describe my current setup:
