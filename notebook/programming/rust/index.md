# Rust

I use Rust occasionally in my hobby programming.

I do not currently have anything to show about this, but I'll update this page when I do.


Here's what I like so far about Rust:

- Pattern Matching to enforce every variant
- Borrow Checker (once you get past the hurdle of understanding it)
- `tracing` and `logging` crates making it easy to have traceability
- Tooling for post-build analysis (and works with `valgrind`)
- Big community, lots of tools (but you need to look for them)
- On windows, try to use `gnu` rather than `msvc` as much as possible to avoid surprises when attempting to cross-compile
