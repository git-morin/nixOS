I'd start by checking the manual of the language I'm writing in.

After that I'd check GitHub's `explore` section for the most popular projects made in that language,
mainly those oriented at developers. (Build tools, dependency management, linting, templates, etc...)

Additionally, I'd want to learn some things from these (which are more generic):

- [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/) - Good 'latin' bases
- [Object-Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) - If I am doing OOP
- [Functional Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) - If I am doing FP
