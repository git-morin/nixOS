# LG TV

I jailbroke my LG TV using this [guide](https://github.com/RootMyTV/RootMyTV.github.io)

My most used application once jailbroken is a modified Youtube client that integrates an adblock and sponsorblock.

I also edited the TV remote's mapping to allow me to open Youtube via the Netflix button (I don't use Netflix) and
execute the PPPoE [[PS4]]# exploit on the Prime button (I also don't use prime video).
