# PS4

I've bought a 9.00 PS4 off ebay (purposely on this version).

This allows me to use the [webkit](https://github.com/kmeps4/PSFree) to [kernel exploit](https://github.com/ChendoChap/pOOBs4) chain to jailbreak my PS4 (as a semi-tethered jailbreak).

I've since started using the [PPPoE version of the exploit](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/PPPwn) (over the webkit) and use my [[LG TV]]# as the connected Ethernet device (which runs the PPPoE server that sends the exploit).

I then run [GoldHEN](https://consolemods.org/wiki/PS4:GoldHEN) which allows me to execute game 'backups', mod said games, and also manage my saves (like back them up).

As a backup jailbreak method, I also have a burned BD disk with the [BD-JB exploit](https://consolemods.org/wiki/PS4:BD-JB)
