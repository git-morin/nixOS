# Nintendo Switch

I bought a nintendo switch that is unpatched (hardware wise) so it is vulnerable to an exploit that Nintendo can't patch.

I've then installed [AtmosphereNX](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere) (a community re-write of HorizonOS,  Nintendo's original OS).

Atmosphere allows me to execute game 'backups', mod said games, and also manage my saves (like back them up).

Additionally, I use a [Moonlight client](https://github.com/XITRIX/Moonlight-Switch) on my Switch to connect to my [Sunshine server](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine) on my [[main]]# machine. This essentially turns my Switch into a steam deck, which I then use
to play single player games on my [[LG TV]]#. The important part to note is that both devices are on the same network, and the client is handling the inputs inside the steam so the latency is very small, enough to not be noticeable even in FPS games.

I've also installed a linux partition on my Switch called [Switchroot(L4T)](https://wiki.switchroot.org/wiki/linux/linux-distributions)
