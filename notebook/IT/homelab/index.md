# homelab

I run [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/) on my homelab server, which allows me to manage virtual machines and containers from a web interface.

## Infrastructure as Code

The VM and container configurations are defined declaratively in my [[server]]# NixOS configuration.

See [[programming/nix/nixos]]# for more details on how I use NixOS.
