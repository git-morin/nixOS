# homelabbing

I run [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/) on my homelab server, which allows me to manage virtual machines and containers from a web interface.

## k8s-@-home

I run multiple [TalosOS](https://www.talos.dev/) VMs through proxmox, from multiple machines, to simulate a k8s cluster for me to play with.

It is currently deployed through pulumi code I wrote in [[typescript]]#.
