# gaming

I like to play single-player games when winding down in my spare time.

To game, I use [Special K](https://www.special-k.info/) to tweak the graphical driver being used by a game engine.

This allows me more configuration than most games offer via their settings.

Here's a list of games I liked:

- [Cyberpunk 2077](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2077)
- [The Witcher 3 - Wild Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_3:_Wild_Hunt)
- [Clair Obscur: Expedition 33](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clair_Obscur:_Expedition_33)
- [Red Dead Redemption 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption_2)
- [Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer_40,000:_Space_Marine_2)
- [Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid_Delta:_Snake_Eater)
- [Baldur's Gate 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_3)
- [GTA V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_V)

Games listed here I've played on my [[IT/jailbreaking/LG TV]]# using the [[IT/jailbreaking/Nintendo Switch]]# as my Moonlight client and the game running on my PC (with Special K and Sunshine)
