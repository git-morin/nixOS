# gaming

To game, I use [Special K](https://www.special-k.info/) to tweak the graphical driver being used by a game engine.

This allows me more configuration than most games offer via their settings.

Since I game on an old GPU (Nvidia GTX 1080) I often need to do some additional adjustments to make games run smoothly.

I've been able to keep up with most games up to this date, here's a list of games I've played this year:

- [Clair Obscur: Expedition 33](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clair_Obscur:_Expedition_33)
- [Red Dead Redemption 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption_2)
- [Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer_40,000:_Space_Marine_2)
- [Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid_Delta:_Snake_Eater)

Games listed here I've played on my [[LG TV]]# using the [[Nintendo Switch]]# as my Moonlight client and the game running on my PC (with Special K and Sunshine)
