# How I root my Android

To root my Android device (currently a `Google Pixel 8 Pro`), I use `PixelFlasher` as my tool.

I currently run the beta builds of Android (and this is not a stopper for rooting).

- Unlocked Bootloader
- `platform-tools`
- Developer mode activated on your device
- the Android image matching what you currently have installed on your device
- a computer with a USB port and a cable that can connect from your device to the computer


The GUI interface of PixelFlasher is fairly intuitive, you should start from the top of the center row and go towards the bottom.
