# Jailbreaking

Here be my notes about jailbreaking stuff.

To me, jailbreaking is the need of leaving the constraints ushered upon us by manufacturers.

Here I am mainly referring to devices capable of computing, which run a restricted environment in the hopes of limiting what the user and owner of the device can truly achieve with their hardware.

> In computer security, jailbreaking is defined as the act of removing limitations that a vendor attempted to hard-code into its software or services.[^1]
