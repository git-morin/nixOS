# Notebook Index

<div align='center'>

Hi Gab,

I've collected some notes and mental thoughts, filled with your opinion.

Hopefully you do not forget their contents too often, and most of all you don't forget to update them.

Remember to feed the cat. Also remember where you put this notebook.

Good luck with whatever you plan to build,

~ Gab
