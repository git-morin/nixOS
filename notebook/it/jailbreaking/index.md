# jailbreaking

I tend to own only devices I can exploit to their full capacities.

Another way to put it is that I hate the modern manufacturer lockdown that comes with most electronics.

Here's a list of notes of my devices that I've had to break out of their manufactured jails;

- [[LG TV]]# How I jailbroke my LG TV
- [[Nintendo Switch]]# How I Jailbroke my nintendo switch
- [[PS4]]# How I jailbroke my ps4
- [[Xbox 360]]# How I jailbroke my xbox360
- [[HPE iLO]]# How I jailbroke the iLO controller of one of my servers.
